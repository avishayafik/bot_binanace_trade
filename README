you may want to get started by implementing half of trading. For example, you do the buying manually and set a threshold for it to sell when it goes that high.

Then you can start a new phase where you implement buying when it's lower than a different threshold.

And then finally you create algorithms to update those thresholds dynamically in function of the prices you have been buying and selling at, and/or the highs and lows of the market.

Add complexity gradually and you will probably have a better idea about how to do it that any of us can have out of the blue.
